            <h2>Learning</h2>
            <p>Learing something new is very interrersing and challenging. Learning specific things is more beneficial than learing many things.It is started with basic knowledge about what people want to learn. As a web web deploper I need to learn some basic concept of html, css, javascript.

            <h2>Practicing</h2>
            <p> Without Practicing learning is not effective. It is said that practice makes a man perfect. We can not understand the concept of html, css, javascript if we don't practice properly, beacause to become a web devloper is not a piece of cake for anyone. I have to cosolidate my own position by working hard.
